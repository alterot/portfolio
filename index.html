                    Is it possible to become a Full Stack Web Developer while having a full-time job and two kids? That’s what I was hoping early in 2022 when I decided to plunge headfirst into the rabbit hole of learning JavaScript on my own. 
                    Before then, I hadn't done much in terms of web development since I was a kid, and the &lt;frame&gt; attribute was super hot, so I wasn’t sure what to expect, but it has truly been a blast and the online community (Code Academy, The Odin Project, Discord) is a tremendous resource. <br><br>
                    Admittedly, it’s not always easy, but every time my motivation or confidence levels sink to miserable levels, I look back at all I've learned in this past year and a half and that really keeps me going!

                    I started off as a management consultant to primarily Fortune 500 companies, proceeded to a business consultant for SME companies, <b>to end up as a front-end developer?</b> 
                    <br></br>After I graduated from my master's studies in Business Administration 2014, I started as a management consultant at EY. 
                    I mostly worked in the consumer product sector with IT-related projects. Since I moved back to Kalmar three years ago, I've worked as a business advisor for smaller companies and focused more on sustainability. 
                    <br><br> I have worked as a project manager my whole career both at EY and my current employer and have a PRINCE2 Project Management certificate. 
                    Now I aim to combine the front-end developer role with my previous business and project management experience to hopefully bring a little extra value to the role.
                    <br><br>And just to emphasize how professional I can be, please refer to the portrait. Pretty amazing, right?

                        I’m confident with the front-end aspects of JavaScript as well as semantic HTML (such as WCAG), responsive CSS and Git/GitHub. I’m currently focusing on learning relevant and popular frameworks such as Bootstrap and React. 
                        I was tempted to start in this end but wanted to learn vanilla JavaScript and CSS first to really understand the fundamentals and improve my problem-solving skills.
                        <br><br>
                        My goal is to be a full-stack developer, so my next steps include NodeJS and MongoDB.

                                and event listeners to handle form submissions when adding new spells and remove buttons to delete spells from the spell list. 
                                I implemented a Local Storage API to store and retrieve data in JSON format.

                                to encapsulate data and logic related to players and the game board. The game logic handles win-checking and draw scenarios.

                    (probably a side effect of having seven siblings).
                    <br><br>I have a tendency to become very interested in certain things, and sometimes I get really obsessed with topics like programming, cocktails, hiking, etc. 
                    <br><br>When I have the opportunity, I enjoy being outside, either spending a few days in the woods or exploring the surrounding areas on my paddle board. 
                    I’m also terrified of seeing how many hours I’ve actually spent on The Witcher 3.
